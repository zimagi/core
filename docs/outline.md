# Part 1: What Need Does Zimagi Serve/Fulfill?

## What is Zimagi?

- Emphasis that Zimagi can abstract data from any type of source, like
  FEC, into a useful common model.
- Can unify data originating from multiple sources/different formats
  through the use of common keys.
- Can be installed anywhere, doesn't require dedicated server\--built
  using open-source libraries and languages, no need to learn a
  proprietary system
- Distributed data imaging and distribution platform, intended to be
  small/modular and extensible, for the satisfaction of different
  business needs
- Zimagi ecosystem
- Two sets of users
- Module Developers and Module Users

## How Zimagi is Different?

- Clarify how Zimagi is different from extent services like Luigi,
  Airflow, and Jenkins
- A Tabular Comparison of what it is and what it is not.

## 1.5 (Possible Section) \-- For Regular End Users:

    * Can Just Pip Install Zimagi
    * How to use for basic operations

# Part 2: Zimagi Components

- Briefly explain about the components of Zimagi and their
  characteristics:
- Modules
- Environment
- Config
- Specification
- Database
- Plugins

# Part 3: Zimagi CLI Commands

- Briefly explain CLI Commands:
- Environment Commands
- Database Commands
- Scheduler Commands
- Data import Commands, etc.

# Part 4: Using your Zimagi Modules (Look at an example Zimagi app, i.e. the FEC module.)

- Briefly discuss messiness of source data (make a case for using
  Zimagi)

## How to Launch:

- Vagrant used to configure development environment:

  - Clone repository and install core
  - Spin up Vagrant instance, then Vagrant SSH

- User Docker Container to ready dev environment for use:

  - Core of Zimagi is a project workspace/environment. You can
    create new environments for business needs.
  - CLI runs Docker container, which contains all environments.
  - Every module has Zimagi YAML file at root, which definces what
    libraries it uses and what to install.
  - Final step of dev environment setup is building container and
    installing everything from Docker image:

  \-- At initial setup, Docker instance contains only Zimagi core and
  Python instances.

  \-- Docker Image is built and saved. Thereafter, Zimagi relies on
  local image, not Docker hub image.

  \-- `image get` sets up basic configuration setting for the
  environment, enables interaction, and creates an initial database.

  \-- When running database in CLI mode, SQLite is used as DB platform
  by default, and it\'s opened/closed on demand.

  \-- PostGres DB can be installed.

## Perform Useful Queries as Examples:

- Into to the command and data APIs:

  - Compatible REST data access system, carries out querying and
    downloading in JSON data format.

- Queries as commands:

  - To import parts of dataset use `zimagi import` and specify name
    of desired slice (ex. \"offices\", \"parties\")
  - Names are defined under \"specs/import\".
  - After setup, Zimagi interacts with API to download data. Can
    define things like URLs in the \"utility\" Python script.

- Queries as RESTful API Calls:

  - Interact with URLs, DataAPIRouter makes API endpoints
    accessible.
  - Can leverage API to view dataset with different filters and get
    data returned in various formats.

- Scheduling data acquisition/updates:

  - Intro to schedule module
  - Demonstrate examples of scheduling

  â€‹ \-- Every single command (like `import`) can be scheduled using
  date-times and arguments like `begin` and `end` dates. You can also
  see all schedules with `schedule list`.

## More Advanced Topics/Customization:

- Adding modules and extending system:
  - Add modules to extend the system. You can add modules by
    providing GitHub repo, default branch is main.
  - Reboot system after installing modules
- How to control data imports and data collection:
  - In specifications, import specs let you control how is imported
    (specify subsets, entries, validators, types, etc.)
  - Plugins/source lets you specify variable types, which can be
    used to slice data as you like.

# Part 5: Building Your First Zimagi Module

Pull current weather data using module
<https://github.com/zimagi/module-noaa-stations>.

## What YAML files need to be touched?

- Everything important to data retrieval is defined under \"plugins\"
  with the YAML files. Zimagi will check under "models" for
  corresponding named Python script.
- Starts with a generic base provider as a parent that is changed with
  the child (extending utility class), adding logic for things like
  pagination, etc.

## What are the keys/values that needed to be created in the mapping?

- Base Data models should define relationships between keys and vals.
- Define key properties for access and use specs to control how values
  are handled (formatted with plugins and providers)

## Publishing a Created Module

## Wishlist of Documentation:

- Need a boilerplate: zimagi.yml in the repository or a command to
  initialize the zimagi.yml file.
