About Zimagi
############

The Zimagi project was started in early 2019 as the core of a cluster
management system.  Our goal was to create micro-service based APIs that could
serve as a gateway and control access to physical and cloud resources in an
integrated environment.

Zimagi allows users and developers to create an API- or local CLI-based
distributed processing engine that enables low-code development and easy
remote management of clusters of machines.

We have tried to make getting started with development, and hopefully
contributing back to the Zimagi project, quick and painless. We
build on top of trusted open source tools and frameworks, including Vagrant,
Docker, Django, Celery, and others. Getting started with the platform
requires almost no setup, and management of the system is designed to be easy.

Zimagi tries to follow and encourage best practices for virtualization,
automation, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD). All actions
performed “should be” automated through CLI and API commands, and by various
scripts (located in the “scripts” directories).

The primary components of Zimagi are a data definition and management system, a
modular plugin system, a local and remote command execution environment, and an
workflow orchestration system.  Together these systems form the core for
effectively managing data processing pipelines in a variety of applications.
Always feel free to recommend improvements in the GitHub issue queue.
