README for Directory: sdk
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory serves as the central repository for all Software Development Kits (SDKs) related to the Zimagi platform. It is designed to provide developers with the necessary tools, libraries, and documentation to interact with Zimagi services from various programming languages and environments.

**Key Functionality**
   Provides client libraries for different programming languages to interact with Zimagi's Command and Data APIs, including authentication, encryption, data serialization/deserialization, and command execution.


Dependencies
-------------------------

This directory itself does not have direct external dependencies, as it acts as a container for language-specific SDKs. Each subdirectory (e.g., `sdk/python`, `sdk/javascript`) will have its own set of dependencies relevant to its programming language and target environment.


File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**sdk/python**
     **Role:** Contains the Python SDK for interacting with the Zimagi platform.
     **Detailed Description:** This subdirectory provides the foundational Python SDK for interacting with the Zimagi platform. It includes core client functionalities, communication protocols, data handling, and utility functions necessary for building applications and command-line tools that integrate with Zimagi services. It abstracts away the complexities of API communication, encryption, and data parsing, offering a streamlined interface for developers.

**sdk/javascript**
     **Role:** Contains the JavaScript SDK for interacting with the Zimagi platform.
     **Detailed Description:** This subdirectory serves as the main entry point and core implementation for the Zimagi JavaScript SDK. It provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for interacting with Zimagi backend services, including command execution, data management, authentication, encryption, caching, and performance monitoring, all designed to be consumed by client-side JavaScript applications.


Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The `sdk` directory itself does not have a direct execution flow. Instead, it acts as a parent directory for language-specific SDKs. The execution flow originates from within these subdirectories when a developer utilizes a specific SDK (e.g., `sdk/python` or `sdk/javascript`) to build an application or script that interacts with the Zimagi platform. The entry points and primary logic are defined within each language's SDK.

**External Interfaces**
   The SDKs within this directory are designed to interact with the Zimagi Command API and Data API endpoints, typically over HTTP/HTTPS. They handle authentication, encryption, and data exchange with these external Zimagi services.
