File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/systems/api/data/filter**
     **Role:** This subdirectory contains the core logic for defining and applying advanced filtering mechanisms to API queries.
     **Detailed Description:** It houses the base classes and utilities for creating flexible and powerful filters, including related object filtering, and is crucial for enabling complex data retrieval operations across various data models.

**app/systems/api/data/fields.py**
     **Role:** Defines custom serializer fields for handling specific data types and relationships within the API.
     **Detailed Description:** This file introduces `HyperlinkedRelatedField` for representing related objects as hyperlinks and `JSONDataField` for handling JSON data within model fields, ensuring proper serialization and deserialization of complex data. It plays a vital role in how data is structured and presented in API responses.

**app/systems/api/data/schema.py**
     **Role:** Generates OpenAPI schema definitions for the data API endpoints.
     **Detailed Description:** This file extends Django REST Framework's `AutoSchema` to provide detailed OpenAPI specifications for all data API endpoints, including filter parameters, response structures, and data model information. It is essential for API documentation and client generation.

**app/systems/api/data/pagination.py**
     **Role:** Implements custom pagination classes for controlling the size and navigation of API result sets.
     **Detailed Description:** This file defines `ResultSetPagination` and `ResultNoPagination` to manage how large datasets are returned from API endpoints. It ensures efficient data transfer by limiting the number of records per response and providing links for navigating through results.

**app/systems/api/data/response.py**
     **Role:** Provides a custom encrypted response class for secure API communication.
     **Detailed Description:** This file defines `EncryptedResponse`, which extends the base API response to automatically encrypt the response data before sending it to the client. This enhances the security of data transmitted over the API by leveraging the application's encryption mechanisms.

**app/systems/api/data/auth.py**
     **Role:** Handles authentication and authorization for data API requests.
     **Detailed Description:** This file defines `DataAPITokenAuthentication` for authenticating users via API tokens and `DataPermission` for enforcing access control based on user roles and model permissions. It ensures that only authorized users can access and manipulate data through the API.

**app/systems/api/data/routers.py**
     **Role:** Manages the routing of API requests to the appropriate viewsets and actions.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains `DataAPIRouter`, a custom router that automatically generates URL patterns for various API operations (list, retrieve, create, update, delete, CSV, JSON, values, count) based on the registered viewsets. It simplifies API endpoint definition and ensures consistent URL structures.

**app/systems/api/data/filters.py**
     **Role:** Defines a comprehensive set of filter classes and a metaclass for dynamically generating filters based on model fields.
     **Detailed Description:** This file provides various filter types (Boolean, Number, Char, Date, DateTime, JSON) and a `MetaFilterSet` metaclass that automatically creates filters for model fields, including support for lookups and related fields. It is central to the API's powerful querying capabilities.

**app/systems/api/data/serializers.py**
     **Role:** Defines serializers for converting complex data types (e.g., Django models) into native Python datatypes that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types.
     **Detailed Description:** This file provides base serializer classes and functions (`LinkSerializer`, `SummarySerializer`, `DetailSerializer`, `UpdateSerializer`) for different levels of data representation (links, summaries, full details, and update operations). It handles the serialization and deserialization of model instances, including nested relationships, and integrates with the command system for data persistence.

**app/systems/api/data/views.py**
     **Role:** Implements the core logic for handling API requests and responses for data models.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains `BaseDataViewSet`, a custom viewset that provides standard CRUD operations (create, retrieve, update, delete) along with specialized actions like `list`, `values`, `count`, `csv`, and `json`. It integrates with filter backends, serializers, and pagination classes to provide a complete API experience, including parameter validation and encrypted responses.

**app/systems/api/data/parsers.py**
     **Role:** Defines custom parsers for handling incoming API request data, including encrypted JSON payloads.
     **Detailed Description:** This file provides `JSONParser`, which extends Django REST Framework's base parser to decrypt incoming JSON data before parsing it. This ensures that sensitive data sent to the API is securely handled from the moment it is received.

**app/systems/api/data/renderers.py**
     **Role:** Defines custom renderers for formatting API responses, particularly for OpenAPI schema output.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains `DataSchemaJSONRenderer`, which extends Django REST Framework's `JSONOpenAPIRenderer` to provide a custom rendering for OpenAPI schema definitions. It ensures that the generated schema is formatted correctly and includes any necessary custom extensions.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   1.  An incoming API request is routed by `app/systems/api/data/routers.py` to the appropriate `BaseDataViewSet` (or a dynamically generated `DataViewSet`) in `app/systems/api/data/views.py`.
   2.  `app/systems/api/data/auth.py` performs authentication and authorization checks.
   3.  If the request contains a body, `app/systems/api/data/parsers.py` decrypts and parses the incoming data.
   4.  `app/systems/api/data/views.py` then decrypts any query parameters and validates them using filter backends defined in `app/systems/api/data/filter` and `app/systems/api/data/filters.py`.
   5.  The viewset retrieves or manipulates data using the application's facade layer (not directly in this directory).
   6.  Data is then serialized for the response using serializers defined in `app/systems/api/data/serializers.py`.
   7.  If the request is for a list of items, `app/systems/api/data/pagination.py` handles pagination of the results.
   8.  Finally, `app/systems/api/data/response.py` encrypts the outgoing response, and `app/systems/api/data/renderers.py` formats it (e.g., as JSON or CSV).
   9.  For API schema requests, `app/systems/api/data/schema.py` generates the OpenAPI documentation.

**External Interfaces**
   *   **Database:** The API interacts with the underlying database (e.g., PostgreSQL) through Django's ORM via the application's facade layer to retrieve, create, update, and delete data.
   *   **Application Command System:** `app/systems/api/data/views.py` and `app/systems/api/data/serializers.py` utilize the `systems.commands.action` module to execute application-level commands for data manipulation, ensuring business logic is consistently applied.
   *   **Encryption Service:** `app/systems/api/data/parsers.py` and `app/systems/api/data/response.py` interact with `systems.encryption.cipher` to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data transmitted over the API.
   *   **Client Applications:** The API serves data to various client applications (web, mobile, CLI) that consume its endpoints.
