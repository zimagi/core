Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   1.  The `zimagi` bash script (external to this directory) acts as the initial entry point, setting up the environment and invoking the Python client.
   2.  `app/systems/manager.py` is instantiated, which in turn initializes `app/systems/indexer.py`.
   3.  `app/systems/indexer.py` discovers and loads all modules, commands, models, and plugins, building a comprehensive index of the application's components.
   4.  For CLI execution, `app/systems/client/cli/client.py` (within `app/systems/client`) is the main entry point, which uses the `CommandIndex` to find and execute the appropriate command.
   5.  Commands (defined within `app/systems/commands`) interact with `app/systems/manager.py` to access various services, such as `app/systems/manage` for service orchestration, `app/systems/models` for data interactions, and `app/systems/plugins` for extensible functionalities.
   6.  API requests are routed through `app/systems/api`, which dispatches to specific API layers (command, data, MCP) for processing, authentication, and response generation.
   7.  Asynchronous tasks and scheduled jobs are managed by `app/systems/celery`, which interacts with Redis and the Django database.
   8.  AI agent functionalities are handled by `app/systems/cell`, which uses memory, state, and communication components to process sensory input and generate responses.
