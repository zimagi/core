README for Directory: app/systems/db
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is responsible for managing database interactions and routing within the application. It provides a structured way to connect to different database backends, handle data serialization and deserialization, and manage database operations like loading and saving data.

**Key Functionality**
   Database connection management, data serialization/deserialization, database routing for read/write operations, and data loading/saving utilities.

Dependencies
-------------------------

This directory primarily relies on Django's ORM and database-related functionalities.
*   `django.conf.settings`: For accessing application-wide settings, including database configurations.
*   `django.db`: For core database operations, connections, and model management.
*   `django.core.serializers`: For serializing and deserializing Django model instances.
*   `utility.data`: For data manipulation utilities like `ensure_list`, `dump_json`, `load_json`, and `normalize_value`.
*   `utility.filesystem`: For file system operations like `load_file` and `save_file`.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/systems/db/backends**
     **Role:** This is a directory that contains custom database backend implementations or extensions.
     **Detailed Description:** This subdirectory is designed to house specific database backend configurations or customizations. For instance, it can contain a `postgresql` subdirectory with a `base.py` file that extends Django's default PostgreSQL backend to include custom connection logic, such as a database lock for connection management. This allows for tailored database behavior without modifying Django's core.

**app/systems/db/router.py**
     **Role:** Defines how database operations (read, write, relations, migrations) are routed across multiple databases.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `DatabaseRouter` class, which implements Django's database routing interface. It determines which database should be used for read operations (`db_for_read`), write operations (`db_for_write`), whether relations between objects are allowed (`allow_relation`), and which models are allowed to be migrated to specific databases (`allow_migrate`). This is crucial for applications utilizing multiple databases, enabling logical separation and load balancing of database interactions.

**app/systems/db/manager.py**
     **Role:** Provides a high-level interface for managing database objects, including serialization, deserialization, loading, and saving data.
     **Detailed Description:** The `DatabaseManager` class in this file encapsulates common database management tasks. It includes methods for retrieving application models, serializing objects to JSON (`_save`, `save`), deserializing JSON data into database objects (`parse_objects`, `_load`, `load`), and handling file-based data operations (`load_file`, `save_file`). It also manages database constraints and sequence resets, ensuring data integrity during bulk operations. This manager acts as a central point for programmatic interaction with the database beyond the standard ORM.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The `DatabaseManager` in `manager.py` often serves as an entry point for data-related operations. When data needs to be loaded, `manager.load_file()` or `manager.load()` is called, which then uses `manager.parse_objects()` to deserialize the data. During this process, `router.py`'s `DatabaseRouter` is consulted to determine which database to use for saving objects. Similarly, when data is saved, `manager.save()` or `manager.save_file()` is invoked, which utilizes `manager.get_objects()` and Django's serializers to convert database objects into a storable format. The `backends` directory provides the underlying database connection logic that these operations utilize.

**External Interfaces**
   This directory primarily interfaces with the underlying database system (e.g., PostgreSQL as configured in `app/systems/db/backends/postgresql/base.py`). It also interacts with Django's application registry (`django.apps.apps`) to discover models and with Django's core database connection handlers (`django.db.connections`). Data can be loaded from or saved to the local filesystem via utilities in `utility.filesystem`.
