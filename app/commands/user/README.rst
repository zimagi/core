README for Directory: app/commands/user
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory contains the command-line interface (CLI) commands specifically related to user management within the Zimagi application. It provides the necessary logic for administrative tasks concerning user accounts, such as rotating user tokens.

**Key Functionality**
   *  User token rotation for enhanced security.


Dependencies
-------------------------

This directory relies on the core Zimagi command framework, specifically `systems.commands.index.Command`, for command definition and execution. It also interacts with the user management system to modify user data.


File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/commands/user/rotate.py**
     **Role:** Defines the CLI command for rotating a user's authentication token.
     **Detailed Description:** This file implements the `Rotate` command, which is responsible for generating a new authentication token for a specified user or the currently active user. It retrieves the user object, generates a new token using the user management system's internal methods, updates the user's password with this new token, and then saves the changes. Finally, it outputs the new token to the console for the user. This command is crucial for security practices, allowing administrators to invalidate old tokens and issue new ones.


Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   1. A user executes the `zimagi user rotate` command from the CLI.
   2. The Zimagi command-line framework routes this request to the `Rotate` class in `app/commands/user/rotate.py`.
   3. The `exec` method within the `Rotate` class is invoked.
   4. Inside `exec`, the command determines the target user (either specified or the active user).
   5. It then calls internal user management methods (e.g., `_user.generate_token()`, `user.set_password()`, `user.save()`) to perform the token rotation.
   6. The new token is then displayed to the user via the command's output methods.

**External Interfaces**
   The code in this directory primarily interacts with the Zimagi application's internal user management system and its underlying database to retrieve and update user information. It does not directly interact with external APIs or message queues but relies on the core Zimagi framework for these interactions if needed by the user management system.
