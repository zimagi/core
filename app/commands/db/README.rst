README for Directory: app/commands/db
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is responsible for managing database snapshots within the Zimagi application. It provides commands for creating, restoring, cleaning, and listing database snapshots, which are crucial for data recovery, testing, and environment management.

**Key Functionality**
   *  Creating point-in-time backups (snapshots) of the database.
   *  Restoring the database to a previously saved snapshot.
   *  Listing available database snapshots.
   *  Cleaning up old or unwanted database snapshots.


Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   This code is designed to run within the Zimagi application environment, which typically operates within Docker containers. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database, Redis, and Qdrant, managed by Docker Compose.

**Local Dependencies**
   *  `systems.commands.index.Command`: The base class for all Zimagi commands, providing core command-line interface functionalities and integration with the Zimagi system.
   *  Docker: The underlying containerization platform used for managing the database services and the Zimagi application itself.
   *  PostgreSQL: The primary relational database system that these commands interact with for snapshot operations.


File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/commands/db/snapshots.py**
     **Role:** Defines the command for listing all available database snapshots.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `Snapshots` class, which inherits from `systems.commands.index.Command`. Its primary function is to retrieve and display a formatted list of all existing database snapshot files. This command is essential for users to understand the current state of their database backups and to identify specific snapshots for restoration or deletion.

**app/commands/db/backup.py**
     **Role:** Defines the command for creating a new database snapshot.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `Backup` class, which extends `systems.commands.index.Command`. It implements the logic for initiating a database backup process, resulting in the creation of a new snapshot. This command is vital for regularly preserving the state of the database, enabling recovery from data loss or corruption.

**app/commands/db/clean.py**
     **Role:** Defines the command for cleaning up old or specified database snapshots.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `Clean` class, inheriting from `systems.commands.index.Command`. It provides functionality to remove database snapshots, typically based on a retention policy (e.g., keeping only the latest N snapshots). This helps in managing storage space and maintaining an organized set of backups.

**app/commands/db/restore.py**
     **Role:** Defines the command for restoring the database from a specified snapshot.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `Restore` class, which is a subclass of `systems.commands.index.Command`. Its purpose is to revert the database to a state captured by a particular snapshot. This command is critical for disaster recovery, rolling back unwanted changes, or setting up specific test environments.


Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The commands in this directory are executed via the Zimagi command-line interface. When a user invokes a `db` command (e.g., `zimagi db backup`), the corresponding Python file (e.g., `app/commands/db/backup.py`) is loaded. The `exec` method within the command's class is then called, which in turn interacts with the underlying Zimagi system's snapshot management utilities to perform the requested database operation (backup, restore, list, or clean).

**External Interfaces**
   The code in this directory primarily interacts with the Zimagi core system's database management layer. This layer then communicates with the configured database services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant) to perform the actual snapshot operations. These interactions involve database-specific commands and potentially file system operations for storing and retrieving snapshot files.
