Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The primary entry point for the Zimagi application is typically initiated via shell scripts like `zimagi-cli.py` or `zimagi-client.py`, or through Docker Compose configurations. These scripts bootstrap the Django environment and then delegate to the `app/systems/manager.py` to load and index all application components. Commands (defined in `app/commands`) are then executed, interacting with `app/systems/models` for data persistence, `app/plugins` for extensible functionalities, and `app/services` for API interactions or background tasks. The `app/systems/cell` directory orchestrates AI agent behavior, processing sensory input and generating responses.

**External Interfaces**
   The `app` directory and its contents interact with a wide array of external systems and internal components. This includes: PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qdrant databases for data storage and caching; Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration and deployment; external APIs such as GitHub, HuggingFace, and Google for integrations; message queues for asynchronous communication; SMTP servers for email notifications; and various client applications (web, mobile, CLI) that consume the exposed APIs. The underlying operating system shell is also frequently accessed for command execution.
