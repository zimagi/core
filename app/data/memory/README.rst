README for Directory: app/data/memory
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is dedicated to defining and managing the data models and database migrations related to "memory" within the Zimagi application. It encapsulates the structure for storing conversational context and messages, which is crucial for AI-driven interactions and persistent user sessions.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Defines the database schema for memory objects and associated messages.
   *   Manages database migrations to evolve the memory data structure over time.
   *   Provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) interface for interacting with memory data.
   *   Facilitates the storage and retrieval of conversational turns and roles (user/assistant).

Dependencies
-------------------------

The code in this directory primarily relies on the Django ORM for database interactions and schema management. It also interacts with the `user` application's models for foreign key relationships.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/data/memory/migrations**
     **Role:** This directory contains the database migration files for the `memory` application.
     **Detailed Description:** Django uses these migration files to track changes to the database schema. Each file represents a set of operations (like creating tables, adding columns, etc.) that transform the database from one state to another. These migrations ensure that the database schema remains synchronized with the `memory` application's models, allowing for seamless updates and deployments.

**app/data/memory/models.py**
     **Role:** This file defines the data models for memory and memory messages within the Zimagi application.
     **Detailed Description:** It contains the `MemoryFacade`, `Memory`, and `MemoryMessage` classes, which are Django models representing the structure of memory objects and individual messages within a memory. `Memory` represents a high-level conversational context, while `MemoryMessage` stores the content, role (user or assistant), and sender of each message. The `MemoryFacade` provides an interface for rendering messages associated with a memory instance. These models are fundamental for storing and retrieving conversational history.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The `models.py` file defines the foundational data structures. When the application starts or when database changes are applied, Django's migration system (managed by files in `app/data/memory/migrations`) reads these model definitions to create or update the corresponding database tables. Application logic elsewhere in Zimagi (outside this directory) would then interact with these models via the Django ORM to create, retrieve, update, or delete memory instances and their associated messages.

**External Interfaces**
   This directory primarily interfaces with a PostgreSQL database (as configured in the broader Zimagi project) through the Django ORM. It also has a foreign key relationship with the `user` application's `User` model, linking memories to specific users.
