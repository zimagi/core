README for Directory: app/data/notification
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is responsible for defining the data models and database migrations related to the notification system within the Zimagi application. It establishes the structure for how notifications and their associated group relationships are stored and managed.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Defines the database schema for notifications.
   *   Manages relationships between notifications and user groups for delivery and failure handling.
   *   Provides a facade for interacting with notification data, including custom display methods for group names.

Dependencies
-------------------------

This directory primarily relies on the Django ORM for database interactions and the `systems.models.index.ModelFacade` for extending model functionality. It also depends on the `group` application's models for linking notifications to specific user groups.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/data/notification/migrations**
     **Role:** This subdirectory contains the database migration files for the notification application.
     **Detailed Description:** Django uses these migration files to track changes to the database schema over time. Each file represents a set of operations (like creating tables, adding columns, etc.) that transform the database to match the current state of the Django models. These migrations ensure that the database structure is consistent with the application's data models across different environments and deployments.

**app/data/notification/models.py**
     **Role:** This file defines the data models for notifications and their related group associations.
     **Detailed Description:** It contains the `NotificationFacade` class, which extends the base `ModelFacade` to provide custom logic for displaying group names associated with notifications and notification failures. This file defines the `Notification` model itself, as well as `NotificationGroup` and `NotificationFailureGroup` models, which establish many-to-many relationships with the `Group` model from the `group` application. These models dictate the fields, relationships, and behaviors of notification-related data within the application.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The `models.py` file defines the data structures that the application uses. When the application starts or when database changes are applied, Django's migration system (managed by files in `migrations`) reads these model definitions to create or update the database tables. Application logic (from other parts of the system, not in this directory) would then interact with these models via the Django ORM to create, retrieve, update, or delete notification records. The `NotificationFacade` in `models.py` provides an interface for these interactions, especially for custom data display.

**External Interfaces**
   This directory primarily interfaces with the underlying **PostgreSQL database** (as configured in the broader Zimagi environment) through Django's ORM. It also has a direct dependency on the **`group` application's models** to establish foreign key relationships for managing notification recipients and failure groups.
