README for Directory: app/data/host
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory defines the data models and database migrations for managing host-related information within the Zimagi application. It encapsulates the structure and behavior of host entities, including their connectivity details and authentication credentials.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Defines the `Host` data model for storing host configurations.
   *   Manages database schema changes related to host data through migrations.
   *   Provides methods for interacting with command and data APIs of a host.

Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   This code is designed to run within a Python 3.x environment, specifically leveraging Django for ORM capabilities and Docker for containerized service management. It interacts with PostgreSQL as its primary database.

**Local Dependencies**
   *   `Django`: Utilized for defining models, managing database migrations, and providing ORM functionalities.
   *   `zimagi` (Python client library): Used for establishing connections and interacting with Zimagi's command and data APIs.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/data/host/migrations**
     **Role:** This subdirectory contains the database migration files for the `host` application.
     **Detailed Description:** Django uses these migration files to track changes to the `Host` model and apply them to the database schema. Each file represents a set of schema modifications, ensuring that the database structure remains synchronized with the application's data models across different environments and deployments.

**app/data/host/models.py**
     **Role:** This file defines the `Host` data model and its associated facade for database interactions.
     **Detailed Description:** It contains the `Host` class, which is a Django model representing a host entity with fields like `name`, `host`, `command_port`, `data_port`, `user`, `token`, and `encryption_key`. It also includes the `HostFacade` for custom display logic of sensitive fields. Crucially, this file provides `command_api` and `data_api` methods on the `Host` model, enabling direct interaction with a host's Zimagi Command and Data APIs using the `zimagi` client library.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The `app/data/host/models.py` file defines the `Host` model, which is then used throughout the Zimagi application to represent and interact with remote hosts. When the application starts or when database schema changes are made to the `Host` model, Django's migration system, managed by files in `app/data/host/migrations`, is executed to update the database. Instances of the `Host` model can then be retrieved from the database, and their `command_api()` or `data_api()` methods can be called to establish connections and send commands or data to the specified host.

**External Interfaces**
   The code in this directory primarily interacts with:
   *   **PostgreSQL Database:** Through Django's ORM, the `Host` model persists and retrieves host configuration data from a PostgreSQL database.
   *   **Zimagi Command and Data APIs:** The `command_api()` and `data_api()` methods within the `Host` model establish connections to external Zimagi Command and Data API services running on specified hosts, using the `zimagi` Python client library for communication.
