README for Directory: app/data/scaling_event
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is responsible for defining the data model and database migration scripts related to scaling events within the Zimagi application. It encapsulates the structure and evolution of how scaling event data is stored and managed.

**Key Functionality**
   *  Defines the `ScalingEvent` data model.
   *  Manages database schema changes for scaling events through migrations.
   *  Provides a facade for interacting with `ScalingEvent` instances.

Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   This code is designed for a Python 3.x environment, specifically within the Django framework for web application development and database interaction. It operates within the Zimagi application's Dockerized environment.

**Local Dependencies**
   *  `Django`: The primary web framework used for ORM, models, and migrations.
   *  `systems.models.index.Model`: Base model class provided by the Zimagi framework.
   *  `systems.models.index.ModelFacade`: Base model facade class provided by the Zimagi framework.
   *  `utility.data.create_token`: A utility function for generating random tokens.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/data/scaling_event/migrations**
     **Role:** This directory contains the Django migration files for the `ScalingEvent` model.
     **Detailed Description:** Django migrations are used to propagate changes made to models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into the database schema. Each file within this directory represents a specific set of schema changes, ensuring that the database structure for scaling events can be evolved and managed systematically across different environments and deployments.

**app/data/scaling_event/models.py**
     **Role:** This file defines the `ScalingEvent` Django model and its associated facade.
     **Detailed Description:** `models.py` contains the Python class `ScalingEvent`, which maps to a database table. It specifies the fields (e.g., `name`, `command`, `worker_type`, `worker_max_count`, `worker_count`, `task_count`, `workers_created`) and their types, defining the structure of a scaling event record. It also includes a `save` method override to automatically generate a unique `name` for new instances. The `ScalingEventFacade` class provides an interface for higher-level application logic to interact with `ScalingEvent` objects, abstracting direct database operations.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   When the Django application starts or migrations are run, the `app/data/scaling_event/migrations` directory is scanned to apply any pending database schema changes for the `ScalingEvent` model. Application logic that needs to create, retrieve, update, or delete scaling event records will interact with the `ScalingEvent` model and `ScalingEventFacade` defined in `app/data/scaling_event/models.py`. For instance, when a new scaling event is initiated, an instance of `ScalingEvent` is created and saved, triggering the custom `save` method to generate a unique name.

**External Interfaces**
   The code in this directory primarily interacts with the underlying database (e.g., PostgreSQL as configured in `compose.db.yaml`) through Django's ORM. The `ScalingEvent` model defines the schema that Django uses to create and manage the `core_scaling_event` table in the database. It does not directly interact with external APIs or message queues, but the data it manages (`ScalingEvent` records) would be used by other parts of the Zimagi application (e.g., controllers, schedulers) that do interact with such external systems to perform actual scaling operations.
