README for Directory: app/data/cache
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is responsible for defining the data models and database migrations related to caching mechanisms within the Zimagi application. It provides the structure for how cached data is stored and managed in the system's database.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Defines the database schema for caching.
   *   Manages database migrations for cache-related tables.
   *   Provides the Django model for interacting with the cache data.


Dependencies
-------------------------

This directory primarily relies on the Django ORM for database interactions and migrations. It implicitly depends on a configured Django project environment and a supported database backend (e.g., PostgreSQL).


File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/data/cache/migrations**
     **Role:** This is a standard Django migrations directory.
     **Detailed Description:** It contains the historical schema changes for the `Cache` model. Each file within this directory represents a specific migration, detailing how the database schema for caching has evolved over time. These migrations are crucial for setting up and updating the database tables that store cached information.

**app/data/cache/models.py**
     **Role:** This file defines the Django models for the caching functionality.
     **Detailed Description:** It contains the `Cache` model, which represents a single cached item in the database. This model includes fields such as `id`, `name`, `requests`, `created`, and `updated`, providing a structured way to store and retrieve cached data. It also defines metadata for the model, such as `verbose_name`, `verbose_name_plural`, `db_table`, and `ordering`, which are used by Django's ORM and admin interface.


Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   1.  When the Django application starts or database migrations are run, `app/data/cache/migrations` is consulted to apply any pending schema changes for the `Cache` model.
   2.  The `app/data/cache/models.py` file defines the `Cache` model, which is then used by other parts of the Zimagi application (outside this directory) to interact with the cache data in the database. This interaction involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting cache entries.

**External Interfaces**
   The code in this directory primarily interfaces with the project's configured database through the Django ORM. It defines the database schema that the ORM uses to manage the `core_cache` table. Other parts of the Zimagi application will interact with the `Cache` model defined here to store and retrieve cached data, effectively using the database as a caching backend.
