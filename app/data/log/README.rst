README for Directory: app/data/log
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory is dedicated to managing and persisting log data within the Zimagi application. It defines the data models for logging command executions and their associated messages, as well as handling database migrations for these models.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Defines the structure for storing command execution logs.
   *   Manages individual log messages associated with command executions.
   *   Handles database schema changes for log-related models.
   *   Provides methods for querying and managing log entries.


Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   This code is designed for Python 3.x environments, specifically within a Django framework context, and interacts with a PostgreSQL database. It is part of a larger Dockerized application environment.

**Local Dependencies**
   *   `django.db.models`: For defining database models and ORM functionalities.
   *   `django.utils.timezone`: For handling timezone-aware datetime objects.
   *   `systems.models.fields`: Custom Django model fields used for data storage.
   *   `utility.data`: Provides utility functions like `create_token` for generating unique identifiers.
   *   `user` application: The `Log` model has a foreign key relationship to the `User` model from the `user` application.
   *   `schedule` application: The `Log` model has a foreign key relationship to the `ScheduledTask` model from the `schedule` application.


File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/data/log/migrations**
     **Role:** This directory contains Django migration files that define the database schema changes for the `Log` and `LogMessage` models.
     **Detailed Description:** Django migrations are used to evolve the database schema as the models change. The `0001_initial.py` file, for instance, sets up the initial tables for `Log` and `LogMessage`, including their fields, relationships, and metadata. These files are automatically generated by Django's `makemigrations` command and applied using `migrate`.

**app/data/log/models.py**
     **Role:** This file defines the Django ORM models for `Log` and `LogMessage`, which are used to store and retrieve logging information from the database.
     **Detailed Description:** It contains the `Log` model, representing a single command execution log entry with fields like `name`, `command`, `status`, `task_id`, `worker`, and relationships to `User` and `ScheduledTask` models. It also defines methods like `success()`, `failed()`, `running()`, and `set_status()` for managing log states. The `LogMessage` model stores individual messages associated with a `Log` entry, including its content (`data`) and a foreign key to its parent `Log`. The `LogFacade` class provides an interface for rendering log messages.


Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   When a command is executed within the Zimagi system, a `Log` entry is typically created and managed through the `models.py` file. As the command progresses, `LogMessage` entries are added to the associated `Log`. The `save` method in the `Log` model handles the generation of a unique `name` if one is not provided. Database schema changes are managed by Django's migration system, with definitions residing in the `migrations` directory.

**External Interfaces**
   The models in this directory interact directly with the configured PostgreSQL database for persistence. They also have foreign key relationships with models from the `user` and `schedule` applications, indicating dependencies on user and scheduling data. The `utility.data` module is used for data manipulation, such as generating tokens.
