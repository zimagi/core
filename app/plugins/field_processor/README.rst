README for Directory: app/plugins/field_processor
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory houses a collection of field processor plugins designed to transform and manipulate data fields within datasets. These plugins provide reusable logic for common data processing tasks, making it easier to clean, normalize, and prepare data for various applications.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Conversion of boolean values to numerical representations.
   *   Concatenation of multiple text fields into a single combined text field.
   *   Establishment of a base interface for all field processor plugins.

Dependencies
-------------------------

The plugins in this directory primarily rely on the core Zimagi plugin system (`systems.plugins.index`) for their base functionality and integration. They also utilize utility functions from `utility.data` for data manipulation, such as JSON loading and collection handling.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/plugins/field_processor/bool_to_number.py**
     **Role:** Defines a field processor plugin that converts boolean values to their numerical equivalents (True to 1, False to 0).
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `Provider` class for the `bool_to_number` field processor. It inherits from `BaseProvider` and implements the `exec` method to take a dataset and a specific field's data, mapping `True` to `1` and `False` to `0`. This is useful for preparing boolean data for models or systems that expect numerical input.

**app/plugins/field_processor/README.rst**
     **Role:** This file provides comprehensive documentation for the `app/plugins/field_processor` directory.
     **Detailed Description:** This README.rst file serves as the primary documentation for the field processor plugins, detailing their purpose, functionality, dependencies, and how they fit into the overall system architecture. It is intended for both human developers and AI models to quickly understand the context and usage of the code within this directory.

**app/plugins/field_processor/combined_text.py**
     **Role:** Implements a field processor plugin that combines the text from multiple specified fields into a single field.
     **Detailed Description:** This file defines the `Provider` class for the `combined_text` field processor. Its `exec` method allows for the concatenation of the current field's data with data from other specified fields within the same dataset. It supports custom separators and can handle both list and comma-separated string inputs for the fields to append. This is particularly useful for creating composite text fields from disparate data sources.

**app/plugins/field_processor/base.py**
     **Role:** Provides the abstract base class for all field processor plugins.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `BaseProvider` class, which all concrete field processor plugins must inherit from. It extends `systems.plugins.index.BasePlugin` and defines the `exec` method as a placeholder that subclasses are expected to override. This ensures a consistent interface and structure across all field processor implementations, promoting modularity and extensibility within the plugin system.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The execution flow for field processor plugins typically begins when a data processing task is initiated elsewhere in the Zimagi system. The `systems.plugins.index.BasePlugin` mechanism is used to discover and load these plugins. When a specific field processor, such as `bool_to_number` or `combined_text`, is invoked, its `exec` method is called. This method receives the entire dataset and the data for the specific field being processed. The plugin then applies its transformation logic to the `field_data` and returns the modified data.

**External Interfaces**
   The field processor plugins primarily interact with the core Zimagi application's data structures and the plugin management system. They do not directly interact with external APIs, databases, or message queues. Their interaction is confined to receiving data from and returning processed data to the calling Zimagi service or component. The `utility.data` module is used internally for data manipulation, but this is a local dependency rather than an external interface.
