README for Directory: app/plugins/worker
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory contains the core plugin implementations for managing and scaling worker processes within the Zimagi platform. It provides abstractions for different container orchestration technologies, allowing the system to deploy and manage workers consistently across various environments.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Abstracted worker management for different container runtimes (Docker, Kubernetes).
   *   Dynamic scaling of worker agents based on demand and configuration.
   *   Monitoring and health checking of running worker instances.
   *   Integration with the Zimagi command and state management systems.

Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   This code is designed for Python 3.x environments and integrates with container orchestration platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes. It relies on the Zimagi core framework and its internal service management capabilities.

**Local Dependencies**
   *   `django.conf.settings`: Used for accessing application-wide settings, such as `WORKER_MAX_COUNT`.
   *   `systems.celery.worker.RedisConnectionMixin`: Provides Redis connection capabilities for task queue management.
   *   `systems.plugins.index.BasePlugin`: The base class for all Zimagi plugins, providing common plugin functionalities.
   *   `utility.data`: Contains utility functions like `create_token` and `dump_json` for data manipulation.
   *   `utility.time`: Provides time-related utility functions for timestamp generation.
   *   `systems.manage.service`: Used by the Docker worker provider for managing Docker services (starting, stopping, checking containers).
   *   `kubernetes` client library: Used by the Kubernetes worker provider for interacting with the Kubernetes API.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/plugins/worker/base.py**
     **Role:** Defines the abstract base class for all worker providers, establishing the common interface and core logic for worker management.
     **Detailed Description:** This file contains the `BaseProvider` class, which inherits from `RedisConnectionMixin` and `BasePlugin`. It outlines the fundamental methods for checking, scaling, starting, and stopping worker agents and workers. It includes properties for agent naming, methods for interacting with Redis for task counts, and logic for ensuring worker availability based on task queues and configured limits. Subclasses must implement specific methods like `check_agent`, `start_agent`, `stop_agent`, and `start_worker`.

**app/plugins/worker/docker.py**
     **Role:** Implements the worker provider specifically for managing workers using Docker containers.
     **Detailed Description:** This file defines the `Provider` class for Docker-based workers. It extends `BaseProvider` and provides concrete implementations for Docker-specific operations. It leverages the `systems.manage.service` module to interact with the Docker daemon, allowing it to check the status of Docker containers, start new worker and agent containers, and stop existing ones. It also handles the construction of Docker service specifications, including image, environment variables, and runtime options.

**app/plugins/worker/kubernetes.py**
     **Role:** Implements the worker provider specifically for managing workers within a Kubernetes cluster.
     **Detailed Description:** This file defines the `Provider` class for Kubernetes-based workers. It extends `BaseProvider` and implements methods for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. It uses the `cluster` property (presumably from a Kubernetes manager) to scale agents and create new worker pods. This provider translates the generic worker management requests into Kubernetes-specific API calls, such as creating Kubernetes Jobs for workers.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   1.  The `BaseProvider` in `base.py` acts as the entry point for generic worker management operations, such as `scale_agents` or `ensure`.
   2.  When a specific worker operation is requested (e.g., starting a worker), the `BaseProvider` delegates to the concrete implementation provided by `docker.py` or `kubernetes.py` based on the configured `WORKER_PROVIDER`.
   3.  For Docker, `docker.py` uses the `systems.manage.service` module to directly interact with the Docker daemon to manage containers.
   4.  For Kubernetes, `kubernetes.py` interacts with a `cluster` object (likely an abstraction over the Kubernetes client library) to manage Kubernetes resources like Jobs or Deployments.
   5.  Worker scaling decisions in `base.py` are influenced by task counts retrieved from Redis, managed via `RedisConnectionMixin`.

**External Interfaces**
   *   **Redis:** The `BaseProvider` interacts with a Redis instance (via `RedisConnectionMixin`) to monitor task queues and determine the need for scaling workers.
   *   **Docker Daemon:** The `docker.py` provider communicates directly with the local Docker daemon to manage container lifecycles.
   *   **Kubernetes API:** The `kubernetes.py` provider interacts with the Kubernetes API server to orchestrate worker pods/jobs within a cluster.
   *   **Zimagi Command System:** Worker providers send metrics and receive commands from the broader Zimagi command system.
   *   **Zimagi State Management:** Worker providers utilize the Zimagi state management system (e.g., `self.command.set_state`) to store and retrieve information about running agents.
