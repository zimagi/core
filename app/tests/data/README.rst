README for Directory: app/tests/data
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory serves as a dedicated repository for various YAML-formatted test data files used throughout the Zimagi application's testing suite. It provides structured configurations, host details, and group definitions that are essential for validating different aspects of the system's functionality, ensuring consistent and reproducible test environments.

**Key Functionality**
   *   Provides predefined configuration settings for testing various application behaviors.
   *   Supplies mock host connection details for simulating external system interactions.
   *   Defines hierarchical group structures for testing access control and data organization.
   *   Acts as a central, version-controlled source for static test data.


Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   The data files themselves are platform-agnostic YAML files. The consuming application components are primarily Python-based, designed to run within a Dockerized environment, and are compatible with Linux-like operating systems. They are intended for use within the Zimagi application's testing framework.

**Local Dependencies**
   The files within this directory are primarily consumed by the Zimagi application's test runners and various utility functions that parse YAML data. They rely on standard YAML parsing libraries (e.g., `PyYAML` in Python contexts) to load and interpret their contents. No direct external software dependencies are required by the data files themselves, but the consuming application components depend on the presence and correct formatting of these files.


File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/tests/data/group.yml**
     **Role:** Defines various group structures and their relationships for testing purposes.
     **Detailed Description:** This YAML file contains a collection of group definitions, each with a `provider_type` and a `parent` attribute. These definitions are crucial for testing features related to user groups, permissions, and hierarchical data classification within the Zimagi application. It allows for the simulation of complex organizational structures and their associated access rules.

**app/tests/data/config.yml**
     **Role:** Stores diverse configuration parameters used for application testing.
     **Detailed Description:** This file provides a comprehensive set of configuration values, including different data types (dictionaries, integers, strings, lists, booleans, floats) and associated `provider_type` and `groups` metadata. It enables the testing of how the application handles various configuration inputs, ensuring that different settings are correctly parsed, applied, and validated across the system.

**app/tests/data/host.yml**
     **Role:** Contains mock host connection details for simulating external system interactions during tests.
     **Detailed Description:** This YAML file lists several host entries, each with attributes like `host` address, `command_port`, `data_port`, `user`, `token`, and `encryption_key`. These entries are used to simulate connections to different external systems or services, allowing the testing of network communication, authentication, and data transfer mechanisms without requiring actual external resources.

**app/tests/data/README.rst**
     **Role:** Provides documentation and context for the `app/tests/data` directory and its contents.
     **Detailed Description:** This file serves as the primary documentation for the `app/tests/data` directory. It outlines the purpose of the directory, describes the individual data files it contains, details any dependencies, and explains the overall execution flow and external interactions related to this test data. It is intended for both human developers and automated documentation tools.


Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The files in `app/tests/data` are passive data sources. The typical control flow involves test runner scripts or specific test cases within the Zimagi application (located in directories like `app/tests/`) loading these YAML files. For instance, a test might load `app/tests/data/config.yml` to retrieve a specific configuration value, or `app/tests/data/host.yml` to obtain mock credentials for a simulated external connection. The data is then used by the test logic to assert expected behaviors or to set up test preconditions.

**External Interfaces**
   The data files themselves do not directly interface with external systems. Their primary interaction is with the internal Zimagi testing framework and application logic. However, the *content* of files like `app/tests/data/host.yml` is designed to mimic data that would typically be used to interface with external databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant) or other APIs, allowing the application's external interface logic to be thoroughly tested in an isolated environment.
