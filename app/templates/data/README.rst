README for Directory: app/templates/data
=====================================================

Directory Overview
------------------

**Purpose**
   This directory serves as a central repository for Jinja2 templates used to generate various configuration files and code artifacts within the Zimagi project. Specifically, it focuses on defining the structure and behavior of data models, commands, and plugins.

**Key Functionality**
   *  **Data Model Definition:** Provides templates for defining the structure, fields, relationships, and API behavior of data models.
   *  **Command Definition:** Offers templates for generating command mixins and base commands, including access control and API integration.
   *  **Plugin Definition:** Contains templates for creating plugin configurations that integrate with the data models.
   *  **Configuration Generation:** Acts as the source for dynamic generation of YAML configuration files for different Zimagi components.

Platform and Dependencies
-------------------------

**Target Platform/Environment**
   The templates themselves are platform-agnostic, as they are processed by a templating engine. However, the generated output (YAML files) is intended for consumption by the Zimagi framework, which operates within a Dockerized environment, typically on Linux-based systems. The framework leverages Python 3.x for its backend services.

**Local Dependencies**
   The templates within this directory primarily rely on the **Jinja2 templating engine** for rendering. They also implicitly depend on the Zimagi framework's internal mechanisms for interpreting and utilizing the generated configuration files. Specifically, the `app/systems/manage/service.py` module, or similar management components, would be responsible for orchestrating the rendering process.

File Structure and Descriptions
-------------------------------

**app/templates/data/model**
     **Role:** This subdirectory contains Jinja2 templates specifically designed for defining Zimagi data models, their associated commands, and plugin configurations.
     **Detailed Description:** The templates within `app/templates/data/model` are used to generate YAML files that describe the core entities and operations within the Zimagi system. These templates allow for the dynamic creation of data model definitions (e.g., fields, relationships, API endpoints), command structures (e.g., mixins, base commands, access roles), and plugin integrations. They leverage variables and conditional logic to customize the generated output based on specific model requirements, such as pluralization, mixin inclusion, API enablement, and role-based access control. This directory is crucial for maintaining consistency and automating the creation of new data-driven components in Zimagi.

**app/templates/data/README.rst**
     **Role:** This file provides comprehensive documentation for the `app/templates/data` directory.
     **Detailed Description:** This README file serves as a guide for developers and AI models, explaining the purpose, functionality, dependencies, file structure, and execution flow of the templates within this directory. It aims to provide a clear understanding of how these templates contribute to the overall Zimagi project architecture and how they are used to generate various configuration artifacts.

Execution Flow and Interconnection
----------------------------------

**Control Flow Summary**
   The templates in `app/templates/data` are not directly executed but are processed by a templating engine (likely Jinja2, managed by a higher-level Zimagi component). A Zimagi management command or internal process (e.g., within `app/systems/manage/service.py`) would typically:
   1.  Identify the appropriate template within `app/templates/data` (e.g., `app/templates/data/model/data.yml`).
   2.  Provide a context of variables (e.g., `name`, `plural_suffix`, `mixins`) to the templating engine.
   3.  The templating engine renders the template, substituting variables and applying conditional logic.
   4.  The output is a YAML configuration file (e.g., `spec/auto/data/<name>.yml`, `spec/auto/commands/<name>.yml`, `spec/auto/plugins/<name>.yml`) that is then consumed by other parts of the Zimagi system to define data models, commands, and plugins.

**External Interfaces**
   The generated YAML files from these templates serve as an internal interface for other Zimagi components. For example:
   *  **Zimagi Data API:** The `data.yml` templates define the structure and behavior of data models, which are then used by the Zimagi Data API to create database tables, define ORM models, and expose RESTful endpoints.
   *  **Zimagi Command API:** The `command.yml` templates define command structures and access controls, which are used by the Zimagi Command API to register and execute commands.
   *  **Zimagi Plugin System:** The `plugin.yml` templates define how data models can be extended as plugins, which are then integrated into the Zimagi plugin management system.
   *  **Database:** Ultimately, the data model definitions influence the schema and interactions with the underlying database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
